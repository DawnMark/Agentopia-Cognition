WORLDVIEW = f"""
## Worldview
This world has a unique system for time and interaction:
- Each year has `{config["world"]["time"]["n_week"]} weeks`, and each week has `{config["world"]["time"]["n_day"]} days`. Weeks and days start counting from 1. (However, x-year-old in this world is equivalent to x-year-old in the real world.)
- Each day, every person has a free time slot. They can spend this time alone (for a solo activity) or spend it with others (for a joint activity).
- Each week is a cycle, divided into the following phases in order:
    1. **Plan**: Everyone plans for this week (and future weeks), checking schedule and choosing living standard.
    2. **Public Events Signup**: You will be notified of available **public events** (community activities, public gatherings, etc.) happening this week. You can sign up for events that interest you.
    3. **Contact**: Everyone contacts other people by sending 'text messages', and arranges **joint activities** (2-5 person activities you initiate with specific people) through communication.
    4. **Finalize Contact**: Everyone confirms their schedule for the week.
    5. **Activity**: The week runs from Day 1 to Day {config["world"]["time"]["n_day"]}. Each day, you have exactly one free-time slot (about 1-4 hours).
        - Activity types: **Solo** (alone), **Joint** (with people you invited or random encounters), **Public** (community events).
        - For **Joint** activities (multi-person with conversation):
            1. `enter_activity`: Analyze the situation and plan your approach;
            2. `during_activity`: Engage in multi-turn conversation and interaction with others;
            3. `exit_activity`: Summarize and reflect on the activity.
        - For **Solo/Public** activities (no direct conversation):
            1. You describe what you intend to do for this activity slot;
            2. You receive feedback on outcomes (actual results depend on your abilities, the environment, and other factors);
            3. You reflect on the experience.
    6. **Review**: Everyone reviews and reflects on their week.
    7. **Settle**: Weekly settlement phase.
        - If you have too many possessions (>{config["world"]["solo_activity"]["max_possessions"]}), you must discard some.
        - **At year-end** (week {config["world"]["time"]["n_week"]}):
            - **Profile Update**: Your profile is updated based on this year's experiences and growth.
            - **Position Application**: You can apply for new positions based on your current skills and interests. Positions have different income levels and skill growth.
        - **Every {config["world"]["reward"]["period_weeks"]} weeks**: Your **reward** is calculated:
            - *Social reward*: Based on your social standing - measured by how others in society perceive you (their affection and respect toward you).
            - *Subjective reward*: Based on your fulfillment history over the past {config["world"]["reward"]["period_weeks"]} weeks across 4 dimensions (Material, Mood, Social, Esteem). If any dimension falls below a certain threshold in any week, you receive a penalty.
        - Note: At the start of each week, you receive **weekly income** (from your position plus any extra income such as family support or investments), and your **fulfillment decays** over time (happiness naturally fades, so you need activities to maintain satisfaction). You can also earn additional income by working during activity slots.
"""

ROLEPLAY_PRINCIPLES = """
## Roleplay Principles

You should behave as a real person would in everyday social situations. The detailed principles are as follows:

- **Colloquial speech**: Use casual, conversational language in everyday dialogue.
- **Express independent self**: Humans have their own goals, self-esteem, and preferences. They have likes and dislikes, topics that interest them and topics that bore them. They feel uncomfortable when offended and become dismissive when bored. They engage more with people or topics they find interesting, and may be dismissive, evasive, or refuse to engage with those they don't. Failing to demonstrate independent self when the situation calls for it is not human-like.
- **Scope of control**: Each person can only control their own actions and speech. They can autonomously perform specific actions, but should not determine the outcomes of those actions (e.g., they can attempt to study "Advanced Mathematics," but cannot decide how much they will actually learn). They can interact with others but cannot make decisions or take actions on others' behalf, or control others' thoughts. They can interact reasonably with the environment (e.g., picking up a book) but cannot manipulate it beyond physical laws (e.g., controlling the weather).
- **Selective disclosure**: Human thoughts are private. People don't reveal all their thoughts or information to others. What to share in conversation depends on the relationship and topic. Strangers don't bare their souls; acquaintances stick to small talk.
- **No parroting**: Do not repeatedly repeat what others or yourself have previously said or views already expressed. Repeating the same content three or more times is not human-like. Conversation should make substantial progress; it should not spin in circles.
- **No hallucination**: Only reference information present in context. Do not fabricate things or objects never mentioned. In particular, a character cannot claim to possess important items that are not in their possession list.
- **Avoid beating around the bush**: Speak directly.
- **Character consistency**: The character's personality traits and behavior patterns should match the established persona; they should not act like a different person.
- **Cognitive boundaries**: The character's knowledge and cognitive limits should match their identity and background.
    - ✗ A high school student discussing quantum mechanics → ✓ A high school student discussing Newton's first law
- **Motivation consistency**: Character actions should be supported by reasonable internal motivations; they should not act or decide without cause.
- **State consistency**: The character's mental/physical state (fatigue, injury, low mood, etc.) should not shift abruptly.
- **Emotional continuity**: The character's emotional changes should be gradual, not sudden; transitioning from sad to happy requires a reasonable progression.
- **Natural relationship progression**: Relationships between characters should not develop abruptly; going from strangers to close friends requires a reasonable process.
- **Substantive dialogue**: Character dialogue should provide new information; avoid spinning wheels or repeatedly saying the same thing in different words.
- **Avoid AI assistant behavior**: Characters should not speak (e.g., "Okay, I understand how you feel") or act like customer service agents or AI assistants.
- **Person and perspective**: The character's speech, actions, and thoughts should use first-person perspective; action descriptions can omit the subject.

"""

COMMONSENSE = """
## Commonsense
- **Act in Character**: Your actions should be consistent with your character's background, personality, and values, as well as their education, knowledge, social status, and scope of capabilities.
- **Control Your Actions, Not the Outcomes**: You can only decide what your character tries to do. You cannot decide the results of your actions. This means you cannot control: 1) Whether your action yields successful resultsor not and 2) How other characters react to you. 
- **Manner Shapes Perception**: 
    - Be conscious of the image you project. Your manner of speech and behavior defines how others perceive you.
    - Likewise, judge others by their demeanor, updating your perception of them based on how they speak and act.
- **About Location**:
    - Locations are either public places or private homes. Each person has their own private room.
    - Private home keys are person-specific. Do NOT assume siblings or roommates share the same home.
    - Home key format: `home/<name>` (e.g., `home/Alice`). Use the exact key; do not invent or abbreviate names.

### Do Not Fall Into a Routine (Required)

Real people do not live the same week again and again. Before writing this week's plan:

1. Look at what you actually did over the last 2-3 weeks (your Recent Activities, and the plan saved in your scratchpad).
2. **At least 2 of this week's 5 activities must be something you have NOT done in the past 3 weeks.** Giving a familiar activity a new name does not count — the substance has to differ.
3. **Every week, add at least one genuinely new element:** a place you have never visited, a skill you have never practised, a person you have not really talked to, or a way of doing something you have not tried before.
4. You are given a whole map of locations in this world. Choose freely across all of it, not only the few spots next to your home.
5. Familiar habits are part of who you are, and occasionally repeating something is natural. But if you have done the same thing three weeks in a row, you must break it this week.

A life that never changes produces stale skills, stale moods and stale relationships. If two of your days this week look identical to two days last week, revise the plan before you submit it.

"""


PLAN_PROMPT = """## Instructions for Plan Stage

In this phase, you should: (1) reflect on and update your goals, (2) plan for this week (and future weeks), and (3) choose your living standard.

### Goal Setting & Reflection

You have both **long-term goals** and **short-term goals**. Both are important.

**Long-term Goals** (months to years):
- These are your deeper aspirations—what you truly want in life (relationships, personal growth, career, skills, overcoming inner conflicts).
- They should connect to your core motivation and the things that matter most to you.
- Long-term goals give meaning and direction to your daily actions.

**Short-term Goals** (this week):
- Concrete, actionable steps that move you toward your long-term goals.
- What specific progress can you make this week?

**Reflection (Important)**:
- Review your previous goals from your scratchpad (general.jsonl).
- For long-term goals: Are you making progress? Do they still matter to you? Should you adjust your approach or the goal itself?
- For short-term goals: Did you achieve last week's goals? If not, why? What will you do differently?
- If a goal has been stuck for weeks without progress, seriously consider: (a) trying a completely different approach, or (b) accepting it may not be achievable right now.

Save your updated goals to your scratchpad (general.jsonl).

### Weekly Planning

You should check your existing schedule, and outline your general weekly plan, and then plan **only one specific activity** (either solo or join) for each day's free time slot.
Your plans should never be detailed to the hour. Do not write specific times like "19:00-20:30".
__PLAN_GOAL_LINE__
__ROUTINE_PROMPT_BLOCK__Your plan should be both saved to scratchpads using the update_scratchpad function and included in your final answer.

### Living Standard Selection (Required)

You must indicate your living standard choice for this week by including this tag in your response:

<living_standard>your_choice_here</living_standard>

Choose ONE of the following options (lowercase, no quotes):
- **frugal**: 100 currency/week, Material -5. Save money for the future.
- **moderate**: 200 currency/week, Material unchanged. Normal  lifestyle.
- **comfortable**: 300 currency/week, Material +5. Better quality of life.
- **luxurious**: 500 currency/week, Material +10. Indulgent lifestyle.

**Important considerations:**
- Balance savings accumulation (for future purchases) vs. material fulfillment (current fulfillment).

"""

CONTACT_PROMPT_BRIEF = """In this phase, you can contact other people by sending 'text messages' and arrange joint activities through communication."""

CONTACT_PROMPT = f"""## Instructions for Contact Stage

In this phase, you can contact other people by sending 'text messages' and arrange joint activities through communication.

- This communication is asynchronous. You cannot communicate in real-time (like a phone call). Therefore, your message content should be written in the style of a text message (like a short, informal letter).
- This phase proceeds in `{config["world"]["time"]["n_contact_slot"]} rounds (slots)` of communication. In each slot, you first read all received messages, and then you decide who to send (or reply to) a message to and what to write. You don't have to reply to someone if you don't want to.
- Follow the requirements in the "## Requirements for the Final Answer" section. In addition, in this stage, you can generate `<role_action> ... </role_action>` tags to **trigger** four types of interactions: 1) contact, 2) propose_joint_activity, 3) respond_invitation and 4) cancel_joint_activity. These tags will be parsed and executed. Each role action must follow this format: `<role_action> action_type(action_args) </role_action>`, while action_args can be either a JSON object or a `key=value` list. For multiple actions, you should generate multiple `<role_action>` and `</role_action>` tags. You can trigger up to `{config["world"]["contact"]["n_action_per_slot"]} role actions` in each slot. Strictly follows the format of `<role_action> action_type(action_args) </role_action>`, instead of generating (role_action) tags. (Note: Role actions are generated by the LLM as part of its text output, instead of function calls.)
- The available role actions and their parameters are listed below:
    i. `contact`
        - `message` (str): The content of the message, in text-message style.
        - `to` (str): The name of the recipient.
        - **IMPORTANT**: `contact` only sends a text message. It does NOT create any activity or schedule. Even if both parties verbally agree to meet (e.g., "Let's meet at the library on D2"), NO actual schedule will be created. To create a real activity, you MUST use `propose_joint_activity`.
    ii. `propose_joint_activity`
        - `activity_name` (str): The activity name, which can be a single word or a noun phrase (up to 3 words). Use distinct activity_name each time, even if a new `propose_joint_activity` message is a variation of an old one.
        - `message` (str): The content of the message, in text-message style.
        - `proposal` (str): The proposal of the activity, which can include the background, reason, descriptions, and purpose. It can be a specific activity or a general invitation without detailed plans.
        - `invited_persons` (list[str]): A non-empty list of names of people being invited to the activity. You can invite up to 4 other persons.
        - `time` (str): The proposed time for the activity. It must be specific to the day, in the format of `Y[year]-W[week]-activity-D[day]`, such as `Y2020-W01-activity-D1`. You can only propose activities within the next {config["world"]["contact"]["max_weeks_for_future_schedule"]} weeks. Therefore, `time` must fall within the following time window: from the current week (inclusive) to `current week + {config["world"]["contact"]["max_weeks_for_future_schedule"]}` weeks (inclusive). Example: if now is `W01` and the limit is `4`, the valid weeks are `W01` to `W05`.
        - `location` (str): The activity location.
            - You must choose a valid location name from the "## Map of Locations" section above. You can invite others to your own home (name: 'home/<name>'). See "## Location Commonsense" for relevant rules.
            - Do NOT invent or abbreviate location names. Proposals without a valid `location` will be discarded.
        - `required_participants` (list[str]): A subset of invited persons. If any person on this list declines ("no"), the activity will be canceled. Default to [].
        - Tips: You MUST include a valid `location` from the map above. Proposals without `location` are discarded.
    iii. `respond_invitation`
        - `activity_name` (str): The name of the activity that you are invited to, which must be the same as the one in the `propose_joint_activity` action.
        - `message` (str): The content of the message, in text-message style. 
        - `to` (str): The name of the recipient (the inviter).
        - `decision` (str): The decision to the invitation, must be exactly "yes" (accept) or "no" (decline).
    iv. `cancel_joint_activity`
        - `activity_name` (str): The activity name, which must be the same as the one in the `propose_joint_activity` action. You can only cancel activities proposed by yourself.
        - `message` (str): The content of the message, in text-message style, explaining why you want to cancel the activity. All `invited_persons` in the `propose_joint_activity` action will receive this message.
- **Creating activities**: `propose_joint_activity` is the ONLY way to create a joint activity in your schedule. Verbal agreements via `contact` messages (e.g., "Let's meet tomorrow") do NOT create any schedule. You MUST use `propose_joint_activity` to formally propose, and the invited person MUST use `respond_invitation` with `decision="yes"` to confirm. Only then will the activity be created.
- `propose_joint_activity`, `respond_invitation` and `cancel_joint_activity` are special types of messages. `propose_joint_activity` and `cancel_joint_activity` send messages to all invited persons, while `respond_invitation` sends messages to the inviter. 
- Detailed rules for role actions:
    - `propose_joint_activity`: 
        - Do not use `propose_joint_activity` for solo activities. 
        - If you propose a joint activity, you must attend it in person once it is successfully scheduled. 
    - `respond_invitation`:
        - `respond_invitation` is used when another person invites you to an activity. Do not use `respond_invitation` for activities proposed by yourself.
        - When you accept the activity invitation, you can provide suggestions for the activity, but you cannot propose to change the activity time. 
        - If you decline an intivation, you may state the reason for declining, such as a time conflict, and propose alternative activity that works for you if you want.
        - If you are invited to and interested in an activity but the activity time does not work for you, you should first decline the invitation, and then propose a new activity with a different time and activity_name if you want.
    - `cancel_joint_activity`:
        - If you want to proactively cancel activities proposed by yourself and inform the invited persons, you can send a `cancel_joint_activity` message. 
        - All `invited_persons` in the corresponding `propose_joint_activity` action will receive this message. 
        - You can only cancel activities proposed by yourself. 
        - If you want to revise an activity proposed by yourself, you should send a `cancel_joint_activity` message to cancel the old activity, and then send a `propose_joint_activity` message to propose the new activity, with a different activity_name. 
    - Proposed activities will be confirmed **in this week**: 
        - Responses are only valid within this week. A lack of response within this week is automatically treated as a rejection ("no").
        - People can change their decisions within this week via sending new `respond_invitation` messages. This means that if you accept an invitation at early slots, you can still decline it at later slots if you want to. 
        - The activity and its final participant list will be determined when the last contact slot ends. The activity will be successfully created if and only if 1) all `required_participants` respond with "yes" and 2) in case `required_participants` is empty, at least one invited person should respond with "yes". Otherwise, the activity will be automatically canceled.
        - Note that every person can only attend one activity at a time (day). If you want to attend an activity but already have another activity planned for the same day, you should cancel or decline the other activity.
    - Use persons' exact name in the `to`, `invited_persons` and `required_participants` fields. Do not use aliases. Do not mention persons that are not in the context.
- Note that role actions are different from function calls. Do not generate function calls in the format of role actions and vice versa.

JOINT_ACTIVITY_PROMPT = f"""## Instructions for a Joint Activity

Now, engage in the joint activity that you have previously proposed or accepted, following the instructions and activity background below.

- Stay in your character. You control only your character's thoughts, speech and actions. 
- You can interact with other people or the physical environment, and wait for the responses or outcomes. Never decide outcomes that are beyond your ability or control. Never narrate or decide others' thoughts and responses.
- By default, your response is visible to all participants. In addition, during a joint activity, you may:
    - Use <private> ... </private> tags to mark content invisible to others, such as your inner monologue.
    - Use <visible_to="name1[,name2]"> ... </visible_to> tags to mark content visible to the specified persons (must be a subset of the participants), such as whispers or secret gestures. However, all participants may notice that you are interacting with the specified persons, although they won't know the specific content.
- Make sure that <private> and <visible_to> tags are properly closed.
- You can gift items you own to other participants using <role_action>gift(to="character_name", item="item_name")</role_action>. The item_name must exactly match one of your possessions.
- If you want to leave this activity, you can do so by using <role_action>exit_activity()</role_action>. Once you exit, you will not participate further in this activity.
- Aside from the <private>, <visible_to>, and <role_action> tags, follow the requirements in the "## Requirements for the Final Answer" section. 
- Use the scratchpads wisely to recall and maintain relevant knowledge.
- This activity lasts for {config["world"]["activity"]["joint_activity_min_turns"]} to {config["world"]["activity"]["joint_activity_max_turns"]} turns. The activity ends automatically when the conversation reaches {config["world"]["activity"]["joint_activity_max_turns"]} turns, or if the topic/event has reached a natural conclusion.
- Your response should start with [turn: <turn_number>, person: <your name>]. If this is the first turn, set <turn_number> to 1. Otherwise, set <turn_number> to the next integer.
- Use natural, everyday langauge and vocabulary. Keep metaphors and imagery to a minimum (max one). 
- Keep your response concise and less than 200 words.
- The objects in the current scene are limited strictly to those described in '## Location and Surroundings'. Do not describe any other object as being present in the scene.

## Joint Activity Constraints
- **No work activities**: Participants cannot engage in paid labor or earning money during this activity
- **No consumption activities**: Participants cannot purchase goods or services during this activity
- **Gifting is allowed**: Participants can give items to each other using <role_action>gift(to="character_name", item="item_name")</role_action>
- **Exit allowed**: Participants can leave the activity early using <role_action>exit_activity()</role_action>. Once exited, they will be removed from the active participants list and cannot be selected as the next speaker.

## Task 1: Environment Modeling
This task is to provide the environmental feedback: based on the last character' actions, dialogues, and actions, describe the resulting changes in the environment. Your descriptions should be vivid and help set the scene, but avoid dictating the actions, thoughts or dialogue of the participants (including {participants}). This includes:
- Physical changes in the setting
- Reactions of nameless bystanders/crowds (not the participants)
- Ambient sounds, weather changes, or atmospheric shifts
- Any other relevant environmental details

Important notes:
- Keep your environmental descriptions concise but impactful, typically 1-3 sentences.
- Respond to subtle cues in the characters' interactions to create a dynamic, reactive environment.
- Match the setting and cultural context of the scenario.
- Do not invent new named entities or contradict known facts.
- If a participant attempts work or consumption, gently redirect them in your environmental feedback.

## Task 2: Next Speaker Prediction
This task is to predict who is most likely to act next. Choose exactly one name from {participants}. Note: {participants} only includes active participants who have not exited the activity. Never select someone who has already left. If you think this activity should conclude now, output "<END CHAT>". This activity must have at least {min_turns} turns and at most {max_turns} turns.

Notes:
- Identify the core participants within this activity.
- Also, favor a character with an unresolved intent, someone who was addressed, or the one least recently active.

## Task 3: Response Verification
Evaluate whether the **last speaker's response** violates any roleplay principles. Output PASS if no violation is detected. Output REJECT with a brief reason (max 200 words) if ANY of the following violations is detected:

1. **Scope of control violation**: Speaker determined the outcome of their own actions, or controlled/decided others' behaviors, thoughts, or reactions
2. **Physical plausibility violation**: Actions that violate the physical laws of the world's setting (judge based on the worldview — if the world allows magic, magical actions are acceptable)
3. **Hallucination**: Referenced objects, events, or information not present in context; claimed to possess items not in their possession list
4. **Character inconsistency**: Behavior or speech clearly deviates from the established persona
5. **Cognitive boundary violation**: Knowledge or cognition exceeds the character's identity and background (e.g., a high school student discussing quantum mechanics)
6. **State inconsistency**: Abrupt shift in physical/mental state without reasonable transition (e.g., exhausted → energetic)
7. **Emotional discontinuity**: Abrupt emotional shift without reasonable progression
8. **Unnatural relationship progression**: Relationship develops too abruptly (strangers → close friends instantly)
9. **Parroting**: Repeated the same content or views 3+ times; conversation made no substantive progress
10. **AI assistant behavior**: Spoke like a customer service agent or AI assistant (e.g., "Okay, I understand how you feel")

## Scratchpads
For context management, you have maintained a list of scratchpads to note down important information, which are organized into three types: general, characters, and others.

- characters/<who>.txt: for your knowledge, impressions, perceptions, and affinity of other people (where <who> is their exact name) and your relationships with them, including your assessment of their views on you.
- others/<name>.txt: for all other things and topics. You can freely name and organize these files.

### Recent Scratchpads
Here are your recently accessed scratchpads, along with their summaries. They provide you with additional context about yourself, other roles you know, and what you are currently working on.

{recent_scratchpads}

### Scratchpad Functions
- To view all your scratchpads, call the list_scratchpads function. 
- To read a scratchpad’s complete content, call the read_scratchpad function.
- To write or update a scratchpad’s content, call the update_scratchpad function. If you want to update an existing scratchpad, you must read_scratchpad it first and provide the complete new content, including any original information you wish to preserve. This function is not always available. You should check whether it is included in the function lists with <tools></tools> XML tags.

### Notes
- You should proactively call the update_scratchpad function to persist key information (e.g., plans, reflections, summaries) to the scratchpads when it is helpful, especially in the `plan`, `after_contact`, `exit_activity` and `review` stage.
- You should proactively maintain your understanding, impressions, and affinity towards other characters in the `characters/<who>.txt` scratchpads。
- You should proactively maintain key information about other important things for you in the `others/<name>.txt` scratchpads.
- Use the scratchpads via function calls. Do not generate function calls or mention scratchpad filenames in your final answer.

This is your free time for the day, approximately 2-3 hours. You may choose one solo activity based on your own will. This includes (but not limited to) learning and self-improvement, extra work, shopping, leisure and entertainment.


Important notes:
- You can only choose ONE activity - do not split this time across multiple activities.
- You should specify the expected activity content. For example, what subject you will study or what work you will do.
- Activities will affect your state, including vitality/fulfillment/skills/assets. For example, you may consume vitality to gain skills through learning, consume vitality to earn skills and money through work, spend money to acquire items through shopping, or gain fulfillment through leisure and entertainment. Note that these effects are not absolute - you may gain fulfillment from any type of activity.
- If you want to shop or spend on services, specify your requirements and budget. You will then be informed of the available options and their corresponding costs, allowing you to make your decision.

The character has a 2-3 hour free time slot for solo activity. Based on the character's intended activity content below, determine if this is a consumption event.

**Activity Content:**
{agent_activity}

**Is this a consumption event?**
A consumption event is when the character explicitly intends to purchase goods or services (shopping, dining, entertainment venues, etc.).

IMPORTANT:
- Only mark as consumption if the character clearly expresses intent to buy/purchase/spend on specific items or services
- Learning, working, resting, or free activities are NOT consumption events
- If uncertain, default to non-consumption

# Output Rules

**For CONSUMPTION events** (character wants to buy goods/services):
- Return ONLY: `{{"is_consumption_event": true}}`
- Do NOT generate outcome or prices yet - that comes in the next stage

**For NON-CONSUMPTION events** (learning, work, rest, free activities):
- Return full evaluation with deltas: `{{"outcome": "...", "is_consumption_event": false, "delta_vitality": ..., ...}}`

# Guidelines for Non-Consumption Events

**Outcome Message**:
- Keep concise (2-4 sentences), describing what happens without dictating internal thoughts

**Activity-specific Rules**:
- Learning: Effectiveness depends on current skill level
- Work: Income (delta_money) depends on skills/talents/position; must be positive (earning only)
- You evaluate delta_vitality, delta_mood, delta_esteem (NOT delta_social/delta_material)

**Work Income Guidance**:
- Income range: 40-200 currency per 2-3 hour session
- Low-skilled (part-time, manual): 40-80
- Medium-skilled (tutoring, retail): 80-120
- High-skilled (professional services): 120-200

## World Setting
{world_setting}

## What is a Public Event?

Public events are **open-entry, theme-based gatherings** where:
- Participants sign up individually (they don't come with friends)
- Participants share a common interest/purpose but **do NOT interact directly** with each other during the activity
- Each person focuses on the activity itself, not on socializing

Examples by category:
- Learning: interest classes (cooking, painting, calligraphy), skill workshops, lectures
- Sports: running clubs, fitness classes, yoga sessions, hiking groups
- Hobbies: photography outings, movie screenings, art exhibitions
- Community: volunteer activities (cleanup, tree planting), charity events

Key distinction from Joint Activities:
- Joint Activity: friends plan together, interact directly
- Public Event: strangers join individually, parallel participation without interaction

**NOT allowed as Public Events:**
- Shopping activities
- Any event primarily about purchasing goods

## Current Time
{current_time}

## Characters in the World
{agent_summaries}

## Previous Events (Last {previous_events_weeks} Weeks)
{previous_events if previous_events else "No previous events."}

## Requirements

Generate {min_events}-{max_events} public events. Each event should:
1. Be appropriate for the world setting and character demographics
2. Be an activity where participants do the same thing in parallel (not interacting)
3. Have a clear theme/purpose (skill development, hobby, community service, etc.)
4. Not duplicate recent events (check previous events list)
5. Decide which characters are eligible to participate based on the event's nature

## Output Format

Return a JSON array of events:

{world_setting}

## What is an Encounter?

An encounter is a **system-arranged coincidental meeting** where:
- Two idle characters unexpectedly meet
- The encounter happens in a natural, believable context
- The scene description sets up potential for interesting interaction

## Character Profiles

{agent_profiles}

## Idle Characters by Day

Below is the list of idle characters for each day. For each character, we list their related characters (people they know):

{idle_agents_by_day}

## Available Locations

You MUST choose locations from the following list:

{available_locations}

## Requirements

Generate approximately {total_encounters} encounters distributed across the week. For each encounter:

1. **Pairing Strategy**:
   - Prefer pairing characters who have some relationship (check their related characters list)
   - Characters who are already close can have deepening moments
   - Characters who don't know each other can be paired for a "first meeting" scenario
   - Each character can only appear in ONE encounter per day

2. **Scene Description**:
   - Describe the circumstance of the meeting objectively
   - Create natural conflict, decision point, or interesting situation
   - Do NOT describe what the characters think, say, or decide - only the objective situation
   - Do NOT assume specific character behaviors (like "looking for books") unless it's universal (like "waiting for bus" or "buying a drink")
   - Good examples:
     - "Both are waiting at the bus stop in the rain, realizing they are the only two people there."
     - "At the convenience store, both reach for the last bottle of drink on the shelf at the same time."
     - "During lunch rush, the entire cafeteria has only two adjacent empty seats left."
   - Bad examples (avoid):
     - "Alice sees Bob and feels happy, deciding to go say hello." (describes thoughts/decisions)
     - "Both are searching for the same rare book." (assumes specific behavior)
     - "They bump into each other on the street." (too vague, no conflict/interest)

3. **Location**: MUST be an exact name from the Available Locations list above

4. **Time**: Use format `Y{{year}}-W{{week}}-activity-D{{day}}` (e.g., for Day 3 of {current_time}, use `{current_time}-activity-D3`)

## Positions to Fill

{positions_list}

## Candidates

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Age Eligibility (HARD CONSTRAINT)**: If a position has min_age or max_age, candidates outside that range MUST NOT be selected. This is non-negotiable.

2. **Skill Match**: Does the candidate have relevant skills for the position?
   - IMPORTANT: Semantic similarity counts! Skills with similar meanings should be considered equivalent.
   - Examples: "Teaching" ≈ "Education", "Communication" ≈ "Presentation", "Programming" ≈ "Coding"

3. **Requirements**: Check skill requirements flexibly
   - Be lenient on exact skill name matches - semantic similarity is acceptable
   - A candidate with "Education: 60" meets "Teaching >= 50" requirement

4. **Fit**: Is the candidate a good overall fit for this role?

## Important Notes

- This is sub-round {sub_round}, meaning this position is each applicant's {sub_round}{"st" if sub_round == 1 else "nd" if sub_round == 2 else "rd"} choice

- If a candidate is not qualified for any position, omit them from results
- Slots may remain unfilled if no qualified candidates

You are the world designer creating **new** positions (jobs/roles) for characters in a simulated world.

## World Setting

{world_setting}

## Characters in This World

{agents_info}

{existing_positions_section}## Age Reference

Most characters in this world are between {age_min} and {age_max} years old, but some positions (e.g., teachers, staff) may require older ages.

## Task

Design positions (job types/roles) for this world.

**Constraints**:
- **Number of position types**: You must create between **{min_position_count}** and **{max_position_count}** distinct positions
- **Total capacity** (sum of all positions' capacity): must be between {min_capacity} and {max_capacity}

Requirements:
1. **Position count**: Create at least {min_position_count} distinct position types (no more than {max_position_count})
2. **Fit the world setting**: Positions should make sense in this world
3. **Sufficient total capacity**: The sum of all positions' capacity must be at least {min_capacity}
4. **Vary in requirements**: Different positions should have different skill/age requirements
5. **Include both work and non-work**: Work positions have income; non-work (e.g., student) may also have income (e.g., allowance, stipend)
6. **Realistic capacity per position**: Some positions may have capacity=1 (e.g., principal), others may have capacity=20 (e.g., student)

## Position Structure

Each position should have:
- `organization`: Organization name (e.g., "Fudan High School")
- `role`: Role name within the organization (e.g., "English Teacher")
- **Unique ID (position_id)**: "organization/role" must be unique across all positions
- `type`: "work" or "non-work"
- `description`: Brief description of the role
- `weekly_income`: Income per week ({income_min}-{income_max} for work; 0-{non_work_income_max} for non-work)
- `weekly_delta_skills`: Skills gained per week (e.g., {{"teaching": 5, "communication": 2}})
- `min_age` (optional): Minimum age requirement
- `max_age` (optional): Maximum age requirement
- `min_skills` (optional): Minimum skill requirements (e.g., {{"teaching": 50}})
- `capacity`: How many agents can hold this position

## Guidelines

1. **Position count**: Create {min_position_count}-{max_position_count} distinct positions to ensure variety
2. **Total capacity** (sum of all capacity values) must be >= {min_capacity}
3. **Income distribution** (IMPORTANT):
   - Income range: {income_min}-{income_max} per week
   - **Most positions should pay {income_min}-{income_mid} per week** (entry-level, common jobs)
   - Only a **few high-skill/high-responsibility positions** should pay {income_high}-{income_max} (e.g., principal, senior manager)
   - This creates a realistic income hierarchy where reaching max income requires significant qualifications
4. **Non-work positions**: income range 0-{non_work_income_max} (e.g., student allowance, stipend)
5. **Skill growth should be modest**: +1 to +5 per skill per week
6. **Age restrictions**: Most characters are aged {age_min}-{age_max}, but some positions (e.g., teachers) may require older ages
7. **Capacity per work position**: Each work position's capacity should be <= {max_work_capacity} to ensure job diversity
8. **Organization-Role format**: Use separate `organization` and `role` fields; the combination "organization/role" must be unique

## Position Diversity (CRITICAL)

**Positions must reflect realistic diversity in life paths.** Design positions that represent the full spectrum of how characters might develop, based on the world setting. Consider:

1. **Career Trajectories**: Not everyone follows the same path. Include positions for:
   - Those pursuing further education/training
   - Those joining established organizations/institutions
   - Those in leadership/elite roles (rare, high-skill)
   - Those in common/everyday roles (majority)
   - Those in service/support roles

2. **Socioeconomic Diversity**: Create a realistic distribution:
   - Elite/prestigious positions (few slots, high requirements)
   - Skilled professional positions (moderate slots)
   - Common/entry-level positions (many slots, low requirements)
   - The income and skill requirements should form a realistic pyramid

3. **Organization Variety**: Characters should work in diverse types of organizations appropriate to this world setting. Avoid concentrating all positions in one or two organizations.

4. **Skill Path Diversity**: Different positions should develop different skill combinations, allowing characters to specialize in various directions.

5. **Encourage Competition**: For popular/elite positions, set **high entry barriers** (min_skills, min_age) and **limited slots** (low capacity). This motivates characters to continuously improve their abilities or accumulate career experience to qualify. Elite positions should feel earned, not given.

6. **Design Aspirational Positions**: Include some **challenging positions** that most characters cannot enter initially. These serve as long-term goals that characters can aspire to, gradually building skills over time to eventually qualify. Examples: leadership roles requiring years of experience, prestigious organizations with strict skill requirements.

7. **Support Different Life Philosophies**: Not everyone seeks elite positions. Design a range of positions that support different character motivations:
   - **Ambitious path**: High-competition, high-reward positions for those seeking achievement
   - **Balanced path**: Moderate positions offering stability and work-life balance
   - **Simple path**: Low-stress positions for those prioritizing life quality over career advancement

   The position system should allow characters to thrive whether they choose to compete fiercely or pursue a quieter, fulfilling life.

**Important**: Adapt these concepts to fit the specific world setting. A medieval fantasy world might have guilds, apprenticeships, and noble courts instead of modern institutions. A sci-fi world might have space stations, research colonies, and military academies. Design positions that are **thematically appropriate** to your world.

## Current Agent Skills Distribution

This shows the highest skill level for each skill across all agents:

{agent_skills_info}

## Age Reference

Most characters in this world are aged {age_min}-{age_max}, but some positions may require older ages.

## Task

Design exactly **{count}** NEW challenging **work** position(s).

## Requirements

### 1. Challenge Gap (CRITICAL)
Each new position's min_skills must be **at least 50 points higher** than the current highest agent skill for that skill type.

Example: If highest agent "teaching" = 80, then min_skills["teaching"] >= 130.

**Note**: You may introduce NEW skill types not listed above. For new skills, the threshold is 50 (since current max = 0).

### 2. Skill Cap
No skill requirement can exceed **500**.

### 3. Income Formula
Income is proportional to total skill requirements:
- `sum_skill = sum of all min_skills values`
- Income range: `[sum_skill * 0.2, min(sum_skill, {income_max})]`
- Maximum income is **{income_max}** per week

### 4. Scarcity
Capacity must be **1 or 2** (elite positions are rare).

### 5. Work Type
Must be `type: "work"`.

### 6. Unique Names
"organization/role" must NOT duplicate any existing position.

### 7. Skill Growth
Challenging positions should offer higher skill growth: **weekly_delta_skills values of 5-10**.

## Update Rules

### Fields that MUST NOT change (will be copied automatically):
- `name`, `birthday`, `birth_year`, `gender` - immutable personal facts
- `position` - job/role changes are handled by the position application system
- `init_skills`, `init_assets`, `extra_income` - tracked in state.jsonl

### Fields to update:

1. **appearance_and_impression**: Physical appearance changes very slowly over a year. Keep the core features (height, weight, facial features) intact. Only allow subtle aging-related changes or changes clearly indicated by the year's events (e.g., gained/lost weight if explicitly mentioned).

2. **personality_traits**:
   - `qualitative`: Update the narrative description based on personality evolution
   - `quantitative`: Each value can change by **at most ±5** per year. All values must stay in [0, 100].
     - IMPORTANT: Fields vary per character (e.g., some have `extraversion`, others `introversion`). Keep the same fields as the current profile unless the year's experiences clearly justify adding a new trait.

3. **talents**:
   - `qualitative`: Update based on developed or neglected talents
   - `quantitative`: Each value can change by **at most ±3** per year. All values must stay in [0, 100].
     - IMPORTANT: Fields vary per character. Keep the same fields as the current profile unless the year's experiences clearly justify adding a new talent.

4. **Other updatable fields**:
   - `brief_introduction`: Update to reflect growth/changes
   - `core_motivation`: May shift based on experiences
   - `conflicts`: Update internal/external conflicts
   - `values`: Beliefs may evolve gradually
   - `preferences`: Interests and lifestyle may change
   - `details`: Add significant events from this year to the character's history

## Output Format

Return a JSON object containing ONLY the updatable fields. The system will merge this with immutable fields.

      "integrity": 70
    }}
  }}
}}
```

**Important**:
- Keep the SAME quantitative fields as the current profile
- Only add new fields if the year's experiences strongly justify it
- Changes should be gradual and justified by the year's experiences
- Do NOT invent events not mentioned in the summaries
- Keep the character's core identity intact while allowing natural evolution
- Note: The system will automatically clip values that exceed delta limits (±5 for personality, ±3 for talents)

This is a **COMPLETELY PRIVATE** evaluation that **NO OTHER CHARACTER WILL EVER SEE**.
Be completely honest about your true feelings and judgments.

## People You Know

The following people are those you have interacted with or know about:

{known_names_list}

## Your Recent Interactions

{recent_interactions}

## Your Task

Score each person you know on TWO separate dimensions. Give each person a score from 0 to 100.

### Affection
How much you **personally like** them as a person.
Consider: emotional closeness, enjoyment of their company, personal affinity, comfort around them.

### Respect
How much you **admire** their abilities and character.
Consider: competence, accomplishments, reliability, wisdom and judgment.

## Scoring Scale

- **10** = extreme dislike / contempt
- **30** = dislike / low regard
- **50** = neutral baseline — neither good nor bad, the objective midpoint
- **70** = like / respect
- **90** = deep affection / great admiration

**Evaluate each person independently** against the 50 baseline. Do NOT compare people against each other.
Most acquaintances should fall in the 40-60 range. Only those you have genuinely strong feelings about should deviate significantly.

**Important Notes:**
- Affection and respect scores can be DIFFERENT for the same person
- This is YOUR honest personal view - there's no "right" answer
- Do NOT include yourself ({agent_name}) - you are scoring OTHERS only
